## 1. Part 1


### 1.1 Split Cache Design

Description of how the split cache (ICache and DCache) is implemented and the main differences compared to unified cache.

### 1.2 Implementation Details

Detailed explanation of key implementation methods, especially the design of the ICache class and the simulation method for parallel access.

### 1.3 Result Analysis

| Trace File | Cache Type    | Miss Count | Expected Miss Count | Total Cycles | Expected Total Cycles |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| I.trace    | Split Cache   |            |         512         |              |    41088              |
| I.trace    | Unified Cache |            |      384            |              |    54912              |
| D.trace    | Split Cache   |            |     634             |              |    67584              |
| D.trace    | Unified Cache |            |    507              |              |    68141              |

Analysis of performance differences between split cache and unified cache for different trace files, explaining the observed results.

### Optimization Techniques Application and Results
(Choose one optimization technique for each trace file)

*No Optimization* means, just use the initial code to run simulation.

| Trace       | Optimization    | Miss Count | Miss Rate | Expected Miss Rate |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| test1.trace | No Optimization |            |           |       None         |
| test1.trace |                 |            |           |     0.371%         |
| test2.trace | No Optimization |            |           |       None         |
| test2.trace |                 |            |           |    5.803%          |
| test3.trace | No Optimization |            |           |       None         |
| test3.trace |                 |            |           |   0.372%           |
